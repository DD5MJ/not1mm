# Things needed

- Show current calls mult/dupe status for each band/mode on the left side of window.
- SO2R
- Multi-Op
- ~~Make bandmap drop focus after clicking spot~~ (Wayland prevents this...)
-"The only thing that would be super cool is auto fill from call history files and the ability to load different call history files for different contests. KJ5T"
